MyEssentials
============

Here I will share my source code for my craftbukkit plugin called My Essentials.

My Essentials is not a remake or a copy of the original Essentials plugin. It was inspired by Essentials.

This plugin is mainly about the commands I want on my server that Essentials doesn't give me. It is also a bunch of commands some friends have requested for their servers.

I am open for suggestions for commands to be added but bare in mind I'm not the best programmer, I might not be able to do the more advanced tasks, so please keep it simple.

My source code is available on here as reference. I ask nicely for you not to reproduce my plugin and most certainly not make money from my work. If you wish to reproduce it or make a copy of it, please ask me first.

Please also if mentioning this plugin to anyone that you direct them to this github page instead of your own. This ensures they are always kept up-to-date with the development and other information related to this plugin.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Enjoy my plugin.
